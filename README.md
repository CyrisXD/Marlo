# Notice
This project is longer maintained but I am happy to accept any pull requests.

Marlo is an open source and free MacOS tray app to directly control your Arlo Security Cameras. 

With Marlo you are able to Arm and Disarm your cameras with just a click of a button. 
You will also be able to view and playback your library of previously recorded clips.

# Installation

To download the latest version of Marlo visit the [releases](https://github.com/CyrisXD/Marlo/releases) page. 

Download the latest `.dmg` file and drag it over to applications. 

If you're having trouble opening the app, try right clicking on the icon and then selecting open.

Once installed you will need to log in with your Arlo account. You can use your main account or use an alternative set up on your Arlo account. 

Make sure your alternative account has all permissions to your devices in order for Marlo to see them. 


# Known Issues

MacOS may prevent the app from starting because it is currently not code signed through Apple. 

Try right clicking the app icon -> then choosing open. 


# Development
Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/CyrisXD/Marlo.git`

Install the dependencies

`npm install`

Start the app

`npm start`


# To Do
1. Beta testing
2. Possibly better design
3. Enable automatic updates through Electron (Requires Apple Developer account)

# Note

This is not an official Arlo application, and has no affiliation with NetGear or Arlo. 

# Support

You can support Marlo by buying me a coffee below. Donations will be going to an Apple Developer Account so I'll be able to enable automatic updates on Marlo with code signing.
